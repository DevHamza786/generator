# Auto Cleanup Cron Job Setup for cPanel

## 🕐 Automatic Daily Cleanup

To set up automatic daily cleanup that runs every day at 2 AM:

### Method 1: cPanel Cron Jobs
1. Login to your cPanel
2. Go to "Cron Jobs" section
3. Add new cron job with these settings:

**Minute:** 0
**Hour:** 2
**Day:** *
**Month:** *
**Weekday:** *

**Command:**
```bash
cd /home/username/public_html/your-project-folder && php artisan cleanup:logs --days=10
```

### Method 2: Laravel Scheduler (Recommended)
Add this to your `app/Console/Kernel.php` file:

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // Run cleanup every day at 2 AM
    $schedule->command('cleanup:logs --days=10')
             ->dailyAt('02:00')
             ->withoutOverlapping();
}
```

Then add this cron job in cPanel:
```bash
* * * * * cd /home/username/public_html/your-project-folder && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Method 3: Simple Daily Script
Create a simple script that runs daily:

**File:** `daily-cleanup.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/username/public_html/your-project-folder
php artisan cleanup:logs --days=10
```

**Cron Job:**
```bash
0 2 * * * /home/username/public_html/your-project-folder/daily-cleanup.sh
```

## 📊 What Happens Daily

Every day at 2 AM:
- ✅ Checks all log tables
- ✅ Deletes data older than 10 days
- ✅ Keeps only latest 10 days
- ✅ Logs the cleanup process
- ✅ Sends email notification (optional)

## 🔧 Manual Commands

### Run cleanup manually:
```bash
php artisan cleanup:logs --days=10
```

### Run with different days:
```bash
php artisan cleanup:logs --days=7    # Keep 7 days
php artisan cleanup:logs --days=30   # Keep 30 days
```

### Run via seeder:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=AutoCleanupSeeder
```

## 📧 Email Notifications (Optional)

To get email notifications when cleanup runs, modify the command:

```php
$schedule->command('cleanup:logs --days=10')
         ->dailyAt('02:00')
         ->emailOutputTo('admin@yourdomain.com')
         ->withoutOverlapping();
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- ✅ **Backup reminder** before running
- ✅ **Dry run option** to see what would be deleted
- ✅ **Logging** of all cleanup activities
- ✅ **Error handling** if something goes wrong
- ✅ **Overlap protection** prevents multiple runs

## 📋 Setup Checklist

- [ ] Upload `AutoCleanupSeeder.php` to `database/seeders/`
- [ ] Upload `AutoCleanupCommand.php` to `app/Console/Commands/`
- [ ] Upload `auto-cleanup.php` to `public/`
- [ ] Set up cron job in cPanel
- [ ] Test manual run first
- [ ] Monitor first few automatic runs
- [ ] Set up email notifications (optional)

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Always backup** before first run
2. **Test manually** before setting up automatic
3. **Monitor logs** for first few days
4. **Adjust timing** if needed (2 AM is usually good)
5. **Check disk space** - cleanup will free up space
